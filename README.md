# MentalState-AudioPlayer
"MentalState-AudioPlayer" is a React Native application paired with a Node.js server, designed to simulate an audio player promoting mental states like "focus", "relax", and "sleep". The server dynamically serves track URLs, while the mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for state selection and audio control.
